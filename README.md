# Reteamer

Seeing your team and org structure in the past, present, and future should be easy.

## The Pain
### Change is inevitable
People leave companies, and new people join. People get promoted, or move to the other side of the country
for family reasons. Simultaneously, the competitive landscape for you company is changing too. We can't stick our heads
in the sand and ignore the change; we have to act. Adapting to change has to be a core capability in order for a company 
to thrive. By engaging in [_Dynamic Reteaming_](https://www.heidihelfand.com/dynamic-reteaming/), we acknowledge that change is real, and we build the are much more
prepared for the obstacles that lie ahead.

### Other applications don't deal well when you start to ask...
- "When should I rotate to another team?"
- "Where should I rotate to next to progress in my career?"
- "What's the next state of this team (in terms of _Team Topologies_) as I try to address business needs?"
- "Where are the open head counts that need filling?"
- "A manager is leaving, but the announcement hasn't been made yet. How can we plan for their departure safely?"
- "Someone is being promoted, but the announcement hasn't been made yet. How can we safely plan for the change to their team?"

## The Benefits

- When you use Reteamer, you tell your new hires that they're getting a level of autonomy that's greater than anywhere else they might want to work
