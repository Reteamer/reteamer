Seeing your team and org structure in the past, present, and future should be easy.

Other applications don't deal well when you start to ask
- "When should I rotate to another team?"
- "Where should I rotate to next to progress in my career?"
- "What's the next state of this team (in terms of _Team Topologies_) as I try to address business needs?"
- "Where are the open head counts that need filling?"
- "A manager is leaving, but the announcement hasn't been made yet. How can we plan for their departure safely?"
- "Someone is being promoted, but the announcement hasn't been made yet. How can we safely plan for the change to their team?"
